    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I am a data scientist for a company called Secure Cams. And it is building an application in which if you take pictures of gym equipments, it should be able to detect which equipment it is. The problem that currently the company is facing it there are many equipemnts in the gym which people have paid subscription for but they are not using it because they do not know what the equipment is and they do not know how ot use it. So, with this project the aim of my company is to build a deep leaning pipeline and implement this in their gym application. So that an user can take a picture of an equipment and will be able to find out what the equipment is and how to use it.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "## üßø **Objective**\n",
    " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The objective of this project is that I will have to build a module which will try to classify the category of gym equipment. For this my company has given me a dataset which has images of many equipments which are divided into diffrent folders. So I will be using these images in the folders and building an accurate Deep Learning Model using Convolutional Neural Network. Firstly I will be going through the full image dataset and trying to remove the unwanted images with unsupported extensions. And then using these images I will be building a model. I will also be doing several experiments in order to improve the performance of the model. I will be including these test results in the I will check if our dataset is balanced and if there is a requirement to increase the dataset so that our model can learn better from the data. Then I will choose the best-performing model to build my final model with the best-suited parameters.\n",
