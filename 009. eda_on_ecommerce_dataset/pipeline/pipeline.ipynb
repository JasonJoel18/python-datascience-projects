    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My client company is JJ motors.\n",
    "They are one of the leading car resellers in US.They have provided me a dataset of vehicle sales data. They want to find some business insigts from this dataset so that they can improve they sales in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧿 ***Objective***\n",
    " I will be conducting  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Vehicle Sales Data dataset and try to get an insights of the dataset. I have some business questions in mind which will help the company in improving their sales. Let's see how we can find the answers to these questions. .I will be loading the dataset and then try to find and any relationships, treands and patterns between among the various features of the dataset. Also, I will be trying to find answers to the below set of questions.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions\n",
    "1. What is the trend in vehicle sales over the years based on the \"year\" column?\n",
    "2. Which vehicle make dominates the sales in the dataset?\n",
    "3. Are there any particular models that consistently perform better in terms of sales?\n",
    "4. How does the distribution of vehicle trims affect their selling prices?\n",
    "5. What body type is most commonly sold in the dataset?\n",
    "6. Is there any correlation between transmission type and selling price?\n",
    "7. Does the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) have any influence on sales performance?\n",
    "8. Which states contribute the most to overall vehicle sales?\n",
    "9. How does the condition of the vehicle impact its selling price?\n",
    "10. Is there a relationship between odometer reading and selling price?\n",
    "11. Are certain colors more popular among buyers, and do they affect selling prices?\n",
    "12. Does the interior type influence the selling price of a vehicle?\n",
    "13. What type of sellers (e.g., dealerships, private sellers) are more successful in selling vehicles?\n",
    "14. Is there a correlation between the Manheim Market Report (MMR) value and the actual selling price of vehicles?\n",
    "15. How does the sale date (month, day of the week) affect the selling price and volume of vehicle sales?\n",
    "\n",
    "**About the data**  \n",
    "This [**dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedanwarafridi/vehicle-sales-data/code) contains 16 columns of sales data"

    "# **HAS TO BE RE-WRITTEN**\n",
    "1. **Year**:\n",
    "   - The dataset spans from the year 1982 to 2015, with the majority of vehicles being sold between 2007 and 2013.\n",
    "   - The average year of sale is approximately 2010, indicating that the dataset predominantly consists of relatively recent vehicle sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Condition**:\n",
    "   - The condition values range from 1 to 49, with higher values representing better conditions.\n",
    "   - The average condition value is around 30, suggesting that the vehicles in the dataset generally have moderate to good conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Odometer**:\n",
    "   - Odometer readings range from 1 to 999,999 miles.\n",
    "   - The average odometer reading is approximately 68,320 miles, indicating that the vehicles vary widely in terms of mileage.\n",
    "   - The median (50th percentile) odometer reading is 52,254 miles, suggesting that half of the vehicles have odometer readings below this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **MMR (Market Median Retail)**:\n",
    "   - MMR values represent the median retail price of vehicles in the market.\n",
    "   - The MMR values range from 25 to 182,000, with an average MMR of approximately 13,769.\n",
    "   - The median MMR is 12,250, indicating that half of the vehicles in the dataset have market median retail prices below this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Selling Price**:\n",
    "   - Selling prices of vehicles in the dataset range from 1 to 230,000.\n",
    "   - The average selling price is approximately 13,611, suggesting that the dataset contains a mix of vehicles across different price ranges.\n",
    "   - The median selling price is 12,100, indicating that half of the vehicles were sold at prices below this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this summary provides valuable insights into the distribution and characteristics of the vehicle sales dataset, including information about the years of sale, vehicle conditions, mileage, market median retail prices, and selling prices."
