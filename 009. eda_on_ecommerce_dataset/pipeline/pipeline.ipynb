    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They are one of the leading car resellers in the US. They have chosen me as their data scientist so that I can analyze some data for them and give some business insights by which they can improve their sales. They have provided me with a dataset of vehicle sales data. They want to find some business insights from this dataset so that they can improve their sales in the market.</p>\n",

    "## üßø **Objective**\n",
    " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The sales of JJ motors have not been very good lately and hence they had to make some very hard business decisions of laying off people in many of their offices. And they are not happy with the performance for the past 4-5 years. Hence they want to study and analyze the market so that they can improve their sales and get back in the business. They have chosen a huge dataset for me, which has details about the car sales until the year 2015.\n",
    "     \n",
    "In their past survey, the people said that their customers were not happy with the options provided by them. So my plan is to focus on the preferences of the customers. This will help me really to get into the minds of the customers and understand what are they looking for in a car they are buying so that my company can use this data to polish their marketing and sales techniques. I will be conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Vehicle Sales Data dataset and try to get an insight of the dataset. I have some business questions in mind which will help the company in improving their sales. Let's see how we can find the answers to these questions. I will be loading the dataset and then try to find any relationships, trends and patterns between among the various features of the dataset. Also, I will be trying to find answers to the below set of questions.\n",

Also `body_mass_index` of a person does impact on the chances of getting an stroke, but in this dataset it did not show the signs of it. Hence it will be better if data collection is done even more accurately to improve the accuracy of the model."
