    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I am a data scientist for a company called TrackFit. And it is building an application which tracks the health data for the user. And they are planning to add an additonal function where it will take some inputs and track the bmi and based on these features it will try to predict whether user has chances of getting a stroke or not. Strokes are one of the leading cause of deaths all round the world. The aim of our company is reduce the number of deaths that are caused due to heart stroke. But giving this stroke prediction function to the user, we are make the user beware of the potential harm and inform him/her to get a doctors opinion at the earliest, which will result is reducing the cause of deaths.</p>\n",

    "## 🧿 ***Objective***\n",
    " <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then objective of this project is to build an machine  learning module which will predict whether an user has chances of getting a hear stroke. For this my company are given me a dataset which has many metrics which has impact on the cause of stroke. So I will be using these features and building an accurate machine learning model. I have specified the steps we will be following in the **Table of content** so that it will be easier to navigate.\n",
