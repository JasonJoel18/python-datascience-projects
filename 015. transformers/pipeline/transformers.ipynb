    "You should build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using a transformer model. In particular, you should do the following:\n",
    "- Load the `IMDB` dataset using [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/loading). You can find this dataset in the [Hugging Face repository](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/sequence_classification).\n",
    "- Build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, including a [transformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/sequence_classification) model.\n",
    "- Optimize your pipeline by validating your design decisions. \n",
    "- Test the best pipeline on the test set and report various [evaluation metrics](https://scikit-learn.org/0.15/modules/model_evaluation.html).  \n",
    "- Check the documentation to identify the most important hyperparameters, attributes, and methods of the model. Use them in practice."
